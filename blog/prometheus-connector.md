[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting tool.
Many different types of data are collected by different tools and are forwarded to Prometheus via various types of exporters.
For example, the [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/) exposes a wide variety of hardware- and kernel-related metrics.
We developed an exporter for Skydive that reports metrics of individual captured network flows.
The connector translates data from Skydive captured flows into a format that can be consumed by Prometheus.
The first implementation of the Skydive-Prometheus connector periodically provides the byte transfer counts for each network connection under observation.
The code can be easily tailored to provide additional flow information.

The structure of the interacting components is depicted in the following figure.

## Deploy Skydive

You can either download a statically linked version of Skydive or you can build it on your own.

To download a pre-compiled statically linked version of Skydive, run the following command.

+{% highlight shell %}
curl -Lo skydive https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive-binaries/raw/jenkins-builds/skydive-latest && chmod +x skydive && sudo mv skydive /usr/local/skydive/
+{% endhighlight %}

To build your own version of Skydive, follow the instructions on [Build Documentation](/documentation/build) to install prerequisites and prepare your machine to build the Skydive code.
Enter the Skydive root directory and build the code.

+{% highlight shell %}
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skydive-project/skydive
make
cp etc/skydive.yml.default /etc/skydive/skydive.yml
+{% endhighlight %}

Adjust settings in skydive.yml, if desired.


The skydive binary is created in `$GOPATH/bin/skydive`.

### All-in-one version

+{% highlight shell %}
sudo skydive allineone -c /etc/skydive/skydive.yml
+{% endhighlight %}

### Multi-node Deployment

Alternatively, run a Skydive analyzer on one host and a Skydive agent on each of your hosts.

On one machine:

+{% highlight shell %}
sudo skydive analyzer -c /etc/skydive/skydive.yml
+{% endhighlight %}

On each machine:

+{% highlight shell %}
sudo skydive agent -c /etc/skydive/skydive.yml
+{% endhighlight %}

Be sure to set the field `analyzers` in the `skydive.yml` to point to the analyzer.


## Create Skydive-Prometheus Connector Configuration File

Start from the `prom_sky_con.yml.default` in the `prom_sky_con` directory.


+{% highlight shell %}
cp prom_sky_con.yml.default /etc/skydive/prom_sky_con.yml
+{% endhighlight %}

The `prom_sky_con.yml` is used as a parameter when running `prom_sky_con` from the command line.

The default `prom_sky_con.yml` has the following fields:

+{% highlight shell %}
host_id: ""
analyzers:
  - 127.0.0.1:8082
analyzer:
  auth:
    cluster:
      username:
      password:
pipeline:
  subscriber:
    url: ws://127.0.0.1:8082/ws/subscriber/flow
    capture_id:
  classify:
    # cluster_net_masks:
      # - 10.0.0.0/8
      # - 172.16.0.0/12
      # - 192.168.0.0/16
  transform:
    type: none
  store:
    type: prom_sky_con
    prom_sky_con:
      port: 9100
      connection_timeout: 60
+{% endhighlight %}

The paramaters in the yml file are inherited from the generic [skydive-flow-exporter](https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive-flow-exporter).
The main entries that may need adjustment are those involving the address of the Skydive analyzers and subscriber.
The `port` and `connection_timeout` parameters under `store.prom_sky_con` may also be adjusted.
`store.prom_sky_con.port` is the network port at which Prometheus will probe the connector to pull the metrics.
This port number must match the value specified in the Prometheus config file for the Skydive-Prometheus connector.
`store.prom_sky_con.connection_timeout` is the number of seconds that have elapsed with no traffic on a connection before we assume the connection is inactive.

### Fields specific to Skydive-Prometheus connector

| Field Name                                       | Type           | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| pipeline.store.type                              | string         | set to `prom_sky_con` |
| pipeline.store.prom_sky_con.port                 | int            | port number used between Prometheus and connector to scrape the supplied metrics |
| pipeline.store.prom_sky_con.connection_timeout   | int            | number of seconds with no traffic before considering a connection as dead |

## Build and Deploy the Skydive-Prometheus connector

+{% highlight shell %}
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/skydive-project/skydive-flow-exporter/prom_sky_con
make static

prom_sky_con /etc/skydive/prom_sky_con.yml
+{% endhighlight %}

## Generate and Capture Flows

### Capture Flows

Via the Skydive WebUI setup captures and generate traffic which should result in the `prom_sky_con` pipeline sending flows to the Prometheus.

To connect to the GUI, open a web browser to the address of the Skydive analyzer at port 8082. If running the browser on the same machine as the analyzer, then connect to `localhost:8082`.
You should see the topology of your network, perhaps something like the following image.

    <img src="/assets/images/blog/capture-future-1.png"/>
  </a>
</p>


Make sure you are on the `Captures` view and press on `Create`.

Fill in the `Targets` fields by placing the cursor in the first `Interface` field and then use the mouse to point to your network endpoint that you want to capture.
To capture a particular flow end-to-end, fill in the second `Interface` field in a similar manner with the other network endpoint.
Then press the `Start` button on the GUI.

Alternatively, you can start the capture of flows from the command line with a command like the following:

+{% highlight shell %}
skydive client capture create --gremlin "G.V().Has('Type', 'device', 'Name', 'eth0')" --type pcap 
+{% endhighlight %}

The command specifies to capture all flows that match the gremlin expression - in this case, all devices that have name 'eth0'.

### Generate Flows

Generate some network traffic on the interfaces you specified to capture.
For example, run some iperf traffic between entities and capture the flow via the Skydive GUI.

To install `iperf3` (on ubuntu/debian):

+{% highlight shell %}
sudo apt install iperf3
+{% endhighlight %}

Run iperf server:

+{% highlight shell %}
iperf3 -s
+{% endhighlight %}

Either on the same machine or on another machine, run the iperf client:

+{% highlight shell %}
iperf3 -c <address-of-iperfserever> -t 10000
+{% endhighlight %}

It is also possible to generate network traffic using the inject feature of Skydive, either from the command line or through the Skydive GUI.
Go the `Generator` page and specify the source and destination nodes between which to generate the network traffic, as well as the characterization of the flow you want to generate.


## Prometheus setup

In the Prometheus config file, add a stanza specifying the location and port used by the Skydive-Prometheus connector.

+{% highlight shell %}
  - job_name: 'skydive-connector'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['xx.xx.xx.xx:9100']

+{% endhighlight %}

Restart Prometheus to pick up the new stanza in the config file.

### Output of Skydive-Prometheus connector

| Metric Name                            | Type  | Description | Labels |
|----------------------------------------|-------|-------------|
| skydive_network_connection_total_bytes | int   | total bytes transferred on connection | initiator_ip, target_ip, initiator_port, target_port, direction, node_tid |

### Verify Operation

Wait for 60 seconds and then check that we have data arriving in the Prometheus GUI.
Look for a metric beginning with `skydive` such as `skydive_network_connection_total_bytes`.
You can display a graph of all the flows that have been captured that report the `skydive_network_connection_total_bytes` metrics.
To see a graph of the bandwidth (bytes per second instead of total bytes transferred) used by flows, you can graph on the variable `rate(skydive_network_connection_total_bytes[1m])`.

The data shown in the graph should contain the following fields:
  * `initiator_ip`
  * `target_ip`
  * `initiator_port`
  * `target_port`
  * `direction`
  * `node_tid`

Each such tuple is associated with timestamps and corresponding values that appear in the graph.
