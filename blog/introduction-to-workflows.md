Since version 0.19, Skydive allows you to automate Skydive actions using a new type of object called `workflows`.
Let's imagine you want to test the connectivity between 2 containers. If you had to do it manually, you would:
- create a capture on the interface of each container
- generate some traffic using the packet injector
- use a Gremlin query to check for flows corresponding to the generated traffic
- delete the captures

In this blog post, we will see how you can script these actions using workflows.

## Workflows are JavaScript

Skydive workflows are written in JavaScript. Why JavaScript you may ask ? Since a pretty long time now, Skydive
has an embedded JavaScript engine that can be used to write complex [alerts](/documentation/cli#alerting). JavaScript is also
the only language that you can use in every browser. With NodeJS, JavaScript became a first class language to write
'real' applications. Therefore, using JavaScript allows us to write JavaScript programs that can be executed:

- from the Skydive command line shell (using `skydive client shell`)
- from inside a browser (using the new `Workflows` tab in the Web interface)
- from a program written in NodeJS
- from Skydive itself (using the JavaScript engine embedded into the Skydive analyzer)

In this blog post, we will use the first 2 methods to develop and execute our workflow.

## Some JavaScript hacking

### Hello World

Seriously, did you really expect to avoid an `Hello World !` example in such a blog post ? For this example, we will use
the Skydive command line shell. When starting it, we will be welcomed with the following prompt:

{% highlight shell %}
$ skydive client shell
skydive> 
{% endhighlight %}

You can write JavaScript just like in the Console of your browser or when using the `node` command. Let's now write
our `Hello World`.

{% highlight shell %}
skydive> console.log('Hello world !')
Hello world !
{% endhighlight %}

Coding in a prompt is not very convenient. You can pass a JavaScript file to the shell instead of writing into the console.
Exit the shell using Ctrl^D then create a file with our "Hello World" and execute it:

{% highlight shell %}
$ cat > hello-world.js <<EOF
console.log('Hello world !')
EOF

$ skydive client shell --script hello-world.js
Hello world !
{% endhighlight %}

### A more complicated example

In this example, we will create a simple API between 2 nodes.
First, let's create a file `create-capture.js` with the following content:

{% highlight javascript %}
function CreateCapture(from, to) {
    var capture = new Capture();
    capture.GremlinQuery = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + from + "').ShortestPathTo(Metadata('TID', '" + to + "'))";
    return client.captures.create(capture);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then let's execute this function:

{% highlight shell %}
$ skydive client shell --script create-capture.js
skydive> CreateCapture("123", "456").then(function (capture) {
    console.log("Capture created ! :-)")
    console.log(capture)
}, function (e) {
    console.log("Capture not created ! :-(")
    console.log(e)
})
{% endhighlight %}

If everything is fine, you should have the output:

{% highlight shell %}
> Capture created ! :-)
{% endhighlight %}

Our `CreateCapture` returns a JavaScript [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
(itself returned by the `client.captures.create` function). The reason is that, to create the capture, an HTTP call to the Skydive
API is done. The actual API will only be done when the Promise is realized with the call to the `then` function.
We provide two functions to this `then` function:
- the first one will be called if the call is successfull
- the other one will be called if an error occurred

Promises are particularly usefull when you need to chain calls and that's exactly what we are going to do with
the real workflow we want to implement in this blog post.

But before that, we will create a simple workflow based on this simple JavaScript example:

## Our first workflow

A Skydive workflow is composed of:
- a name and an optional description of what the workflow does
- the parameters to pass to this workflow
- and of course, the JavaScript code for this workflow

Workflows can be uploaded to the Skydive API through a YAML file. Let's create the corresponding file `create-capture.yml` for our previous example.

{% highlight yaml %}
---
name: "CreateCapture"
description: "Create captures on all the nodes of a path between two selected nodes"
parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Source node
    type: node
  - name: destination
    description: Destination node
    type: node
source: |
    function CreateCapture(from, to) {
        var capture = new Capture();
        capture.GremlinQuery = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + from + "').ShortestPathTo(Metadata('TID', '" + to + "'))";
        return client.captures.create(capture);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

You will have recognized the JavaScript code of our previous example. Now let's upload it to the Skydive API:

{% highlight shell %}
$ skydive client workflow create --path create-capture.yml
{
  "UUID": "a7e34f4e-9252-4415-70c5-7c872347024c",
  "Name": "CreateCapture",
  "Description": "Create captures on all the nodes of a path between two selected nodes",
  "Parameters": [
    {
      "Name": "source",
      "Description": "Source node",
      "Type": "node",
      "Default": null,
      "Values": null
    },
    {
      "Name": "destination",
      "Description": "Destination node",
      "Type": "node",
      "Default": null,
      "Values": null
    }
  ],
  "Source": "function CreateCapture(from, to) {\n    var capture = new Capture();\n    capture.GremlinQuery = \"G.V().Has('TID', '\" + from + \"').ShortestPathTo(Metadata('TID', '\" + to + \"'))\";\n    return client.captures.create(capture);\n}\n"
}
{% endhighlight %}

If we now go the the Skydive WebUI and click on the `Workflows` tab on the top right, you should be see our new workflow:

<p>
  <a href="/assets/images/blog/introduction-workflows-1.png" data-lightbox="WebUI-1" data-title="Skydive WebUI">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/introduction-workflows-1.png"/>
  </a>
</p>

If you select this new `CreateCapture` workflow, two input fields - corresponding to the parameters of our workflow - will appear.
As our parameters have the `node` type, they will appear as node selectors. Select a source node and a destination, then click on `Execute`. The capture should have been successfully created.

## Wrapping everything together

Now that we saw how to develop JavaScript code and create the corresponding workflow, let's move to our real example.
As said above, we will use Promises to chain the actions. The JavaScript code for our example could be written like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function CheckConnectivity(from, to) {
    var capture = new Capture();
    capture.GremlinQuery = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + from + "').ShortestPathTo(Metadata('TID', '" + to + "'))";

    var packetInjection = new PacketInjection();
    packetInjection.Src = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + from + "')"
    packetInjection.Dst = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + to + "')"
    packetInjection.Type = "icmp4"
    packetInjection.ICMPID = 123
    packetInjection.Count = 5

    return client.captures.create(capture).then(function (c) {
        capture = c
        return sleep(2000)
    }).then(function () {
        return client.packetInjections.create(packetInjection)
    }).then(function () {
        return sleep(2000)
    }).then(function () {
        return client.G.Flows().Has("ICMP.ID", 123)
    }).then(function (flows) {
        console.log("Flows requested ! :-)")
        console.log(flows)
        return { "State": true, "Flows": flows }
    }).finally(function () {
        client.captures.delete(capture.UUID)
    })
}
{% endhighlight %}

and the YAML for this workflow could be written like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
---
name: "CheckConnectivity"
description: "Test connectivity between two interfaces"
parameters:
  - name: source
    description: Source node
    type: node
  - name: destination
    description: Destination node
    type: node
source: |
    function CheckConnectivity(from, to) {
        var capture = new Capture();
        capture.GremlinQuery = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + from + "').ShortestPathTo(Metadata('TID', '" + to + "'))";

        var packetInjection = new PacketInjection();
        packetInjection.Src = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + from + "')"
        packetInjection.Dst = "G.V().Has('TID', '" + to + "')"
        packetInjection.Type = "icmp4"
        packetInjection.ICMPID = 123
        packetInjection.Count = 5

        return client.captures.create(capture).then(function (c) {
            capture = c
            return sleep(2000)
        }).then(function () {
            return client.packetInjections.create(packetInjection)
        }).then(function () {
            return sleep(2000)
        }).then(function () {
            return client.G.Flows().Has("ICMP.ID", 123)
        }).then(function (flows) {
            console.log("Flows requested ! :-)")
            console.log(flows)
            return { "State": true, "Flows": flows }
        }).finally(function () {
            client.captures.delete(capture.UUID)
        })
    }
{% endhighlight %}

You can notice that we wait for 2 seconds between the capture creation and the packet injection to
give Skydive some time to create the capture on the agent. We also wait a bit before querying the
flows to let them enter the agent's flow table.

The flow query is done using `client.G.Flows().Has("ICMP.ID", 123)`. The JavaScript API mimics the
Gremlin syntax and returns a promise that, when realized, will make a single request to the Skydive
analyzer with the full Gremlin request.

Our workflow returns an object with:
- State: that can be either `true` or `false`
- Flows: the ICMP flows that were found

Let's upload our complete workflow:

{% highlight shell %}
$ skydive client workflow create --path check-connectivity.yml
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, let's run our workflow using the WebUI will give the following output:

  </a>

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we saw how to develop our own workflow. A few workflows are already bundled into Skydive such as
[FlowMatrix](https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive/blob/master/statics/workflows/flow-matrix.yaml) which is
the flow matrix utility described [in a previous blog post](/blog/flow-matrix.html), originally written in Python
as an external tool that was converted into a Skydive workflow. The list of available workflows is small as the
feature was added recently but expect more to appear soon. Don't hesitate to [submit your workflow as a pull request](/documentation/contribute), your help will me really much appreciated.
